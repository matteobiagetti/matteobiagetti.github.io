Presented "Bayesian Feature Extraction for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy" at the Symposium for Data-Driven Approaches in X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy ([DataXAS](https://indico.psi.ch/event/17715/overview)) at ETHZ-Hönggerberg in Zurich, Switzerland.

We presented a Bayesian approach for uncertainty-aware, interpretable feature extraction from operando/ambient-pressure NEXAFS spectra, where structured backgrounds and overlapping near-edge features make standard baseline subtraction unstable.
