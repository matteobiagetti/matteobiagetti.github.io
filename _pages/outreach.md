**Trieste Next Festival 2025**  
_Piazza Unità d'Italia, Trieste, Italy_  
_September 26, 2025 | 11:00-11:45_

A panel discussion exploring how language models work and how Artificial Intelligence can generate texts that appear human-written. A journey of exploration with Area Science Park's scientists and researchers to reflect upon our relationship with technology and data, the valuable information underlying all models.

**Panel with**: Matteo Biagetti and Mariarita De Luca (Research Scientists, Laboratory of Data Engineering, Area Science Park)

**Venue**: Area Talk 2, Piazza Unità d'Italia

Event organized by Area Science Park as part of the Trieste Next science festival.

## Dalle strutture cosmiche all'intelligenza artificiale: un viaggio attraverso le lenti della topologia

**Pint of Science Festival 2024**  
_Meeting Point, Galleria Fenice 6, Trieste, Italy_  
_May 13, 2024 | 19:30_

An exploration of the shape of data through the lens of mathematics. From galaxies and planets in the sky to atoms under microscopes, from our daily data—movements, photos, messages—to data generated by artificial intelligence, we observe data of all kinds in nature. This talk defines what it means to study the shape of these data and how this gives us essential information about them.

**Topics covered**: Topological data analysis applied to cosmological structures, neural networks, and artificial intelligence systems

**Venue**: Meeting Point Bar, Galleria Fenice 6

Part of the international Pint of Science festival bringing researchers to pubs to share their scientific discoveries with the public in an informal setting.
