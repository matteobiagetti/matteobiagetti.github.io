I am a research scientist. After working for several years in theoretical cosmology, I've recently moved towards data-oriented research. I am interested in the topological and geometric structure underlying high dimensional data from various datasets, ranging from cosmological datasets to representations in biological and artificial neural networks.

I am currently employed as a Staff Researcher at the Laboratory of Data Engineering ([LADE](https://en.areasciencepark.it/rdplatform-2023/lade-laboratorio-di-data-engeneering/)) at the Institute of Research and Technological Innovation, Area Science Park in Trieste, Italy.

My research interests include:

- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Applying topological methods to understand high-dimensional data structures
- **Machine Learning**: Particularly in the context of large language models and neural network representations
- **Theoretical Physics**: Background in cosmology and theoretical physics applications
