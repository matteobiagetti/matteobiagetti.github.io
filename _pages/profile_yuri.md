I am a PhD student in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at University of Trieste, doing my PhD in collaboration with AREA Science Park. I am currently visiting INRIA in the Datashape team in Sophia-Antipolis, collaborating with Mathieu Carrière.

My research focuses on Topological Data Analysis and Interpretability of Large Language Models. By background I am a Computer Scientist (Master and Bachelor from University of Modena and Reggio Emilia), passionate about multidisciplinary problems.

**Recent work:**

- Interpretability of LLMs using TDA (ICML'25)
- Topological Data Analysis on neuroscience data
- Complex Systems (Sensors'24)
