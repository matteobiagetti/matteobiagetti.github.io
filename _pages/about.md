I am a research scientist with expertise in topological data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications for scientific discovery. After working for several years in theoretical cosmology, I've recently moved towards data-oriented research. Matteo Biagetti specializes in understanding the topological and geometric structure underlying high dimensional data from various datasets, ranging from cosmological datasets to representations in biological and artificial neural networks.

I am currently employed as a Senior Staff Researcher at the Laboratory of Data Engineering at the Institute of Research and Technological Innovation, Area Science Park in Trieste, Italy. I also serve as an Assistant Professor at the University of Trieste, where I teach Applied Artificial Intelligence for the Master in Data Science and Computational Sciences (MDMC).

My research interests include:

- **Topological Data Analysis**: Applying topological methods to understand high-dimensional data structures
- **Foundations of Artificial Intelligence**: Particularly in the context of interpretability of transformers and multimodal models via geometrical and topological data analysis
- **Machine Learning for Scientific Applications**: Developing tools for denoising and analysing spectroscopic data
