Presented "Zigzag Persistence of Neural Responses to Time-Varying Stimuli" at the [GTML 2025 Workshop](https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/series/workshop-on-geometry-topology-and-machine-learning-gtml-2025) at MPI für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften in Leipzig, Germany.

We used topological data analysis to study neural population activity in the Sensorium 2023 dataset, applying zigzag persistent homology to capture how topological structure evolves in response to video stimuli.
