I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Amsterdam in the Institute of Physics, working on the interpretability of large language models. Prior to this, I was working on analyzing the large scale structure of the universe using topological data analysis.

Currently I am working on AI safety projects that include architectural modifications to externalize reasoning in LLMs and interpreting LLMs using computational mechanics.
