I am a research scientist. I work on methods that uncover structure in high-dimensional data.  I earned a PhD in theoretical physics and spent several years in theoretical cosmology before moving toward data-driven research. Drawing from physics and mathematics, I use topological and geometric ideas to build machine-learning tools that are easier to interpret and useful in scientific settings—from cosmology to neural representations.

Research interests

- Topological and geometric data analysis
- Interpretability in modern AI (transformers, multimodal models)
- Scientific ML for spectroscopic data (denoising, analysis)

I am currently employed as a Staff Researcher at the Laboratory of Data Engineering at the Institute of Research and Technological Innovation, Area Science Park in Trieste, Italy.
