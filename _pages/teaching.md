## Applied AI Course

**Master in Data Management and Curation (MDMC)**  
_Area Science Park & SISSA, Trieste, Italy_

A hands-on, project-based course where students work in teams to develop comprehensive AI solutions for real-world data challenges. Students apply machine learning techniques to raw datasets while adhering to FAIR principles and open science methodologies.

**Key Components:**

- **Project Development**: Teams of 4-5 students tackle real-world datasets and implement end-to-end solutions from data curation to model deployment
- **Technical Implementation**: Python programming, machine learning model development, and data structure interface design
- **FAIR & Open Science**: All work is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and interoperable, following FAIR-by-design principles

**Course Structure**: 30 hours including dataset exploration, strategy development, iterative implementation with feedback sessions, and final project presentation

**Datasets**: Students work with diverse datasets including neuroscience data (Sensorium competition) and nanomaterials imaging (SEM images), enriching them with metadata and building visualization tools for efficient data navigation and exploration.

## Theoretical Aspects of Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation

**PhD School - Exercise Sessions on Inflation**  
_Galileo Galilei Institute, Florence, Italy_  
_March 2025_

Instructor for exercise sessions accompanying lectures on inflationary cosmology by Prof. Antonio Riotto at the annual GGI doctoral school. The school provides rigorous introductions to theoretical concepts and computational tools in astroparticle physics, cosmology, and gravitation.

**Topics Covered**: Inflation theory, gravitational waves, neutrino physics, dark matter searches, and cosmic ray physics through lectures complemented by hands-on computational sessions and discussion periods.

**Role**: Led exercise sessions and office hours helping students apply theoretical concepts to practical problems in inflationary cosmology.
