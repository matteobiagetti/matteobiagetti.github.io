    - title: Current Research
      items:
        - After working for several years in theoretical cosmology, I have recently moved towards data-oriented research.
        - I am interested in the topological and geometric structure underlying high dimensional data from various datasets, ranging from cosmological datasets to representations in biological and artificial neural networks.
        - I also work on applying bayesian inference to XAS spectroscopy data for material science applications.
