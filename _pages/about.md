I am a research scientist. After working for several years in theoretical cosmology, I've recently moved towards data-oriented research. I am interested in the topological and geometric structure underlying high dimensional data from various datasets, ranging from cosmological datasets to representations in biological and artificial neural networks.

I am currently employed as a Staff Researcher at the Laboratory of Data Engineering at the Institute of Research and Technological Innovation, Area Science Park in Trieste, Italy.

My research interests include:

- **Topological Data Analysis**: Applying topological methods to understand high-dimensional data structures
- **Foundations of Artificial Intelligence**: Particularly in the context of interpretability of transformers and multimodal models via geometrical and topological data analysis
- **Machine Learning for Scientific Applications**: Developing tools for denoising and analysing spectroscopic data
